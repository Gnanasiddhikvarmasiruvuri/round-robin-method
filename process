Create two queues, one for students and one for faculty.
Set up a timer for two hours, from 10am to 12pm.
While the timer is running:
a. If there are queries in the student queue, pick up the next query and spend a fixed amount of time on it (e.g., 10 minutes).
b. If there are queries in the faculty queue, pick up the next query and spend a fixed amount of time on it (e.g., 15 minutes).
After the timer has ended, calculate the total time spent on handling queries and the average query time.
Here's an example session log:

10:00am - Logged into the system
10:05am - Started handling student query 1
10:15am - Finished handling student query 1
10:20am - Started handling faculty query 1
10:35am - Finished handling faculty query 1
10:40am - Started handling student query 2
10:50am - Finished handling student query 2
11:00am - Started handling faculty query 2
11:15am - Finished handling faculty query 2
